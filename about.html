        <h1>But First, A Little History...</h1>
        <p>When I'm not working for The Walt Disney Company via the Disney College Program, braving Amazon's famous Peak Seasons, or developing sites through HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I'm creating digital art prints and producing comics through my comics brand, Vixen Comix! Creating comics all about fantasy, mystery, and life's great struggles, practicing web development gives me the chance to place my art prints and comics in a site that is uniquely mine. Inspired by the likes of Disney, Don Bluth, and Universal, I am currently acquiring funds to produce my own animated short film featuring the characters from my current comic, 
            <a href="vowcomic.tumblr.com"><i>The Vale of Wales</i></a>, a fantasy-adventure story about the folklore of Wales and our human need for fellowship during times of trouble. In the midst of my fundraising and comic production, I have made a collection of art prints to sell on my <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/lightening816/shop">Redbubble Store!</a>.</p>
        <p>In my web development career, I've configured combination locks, have created and simplified the quintessential grocery list, and have developed Fun Fact sheets for a variety of zoo animals. With my appreciation for Frontend Developement, I hope to design visually appealing personal sites, efficient databases, and useful articles for anyone and everyone!</p>
        <p>Feel free to check our my portfolio for multiple examples of my web development work and my digital art prints.</p>
